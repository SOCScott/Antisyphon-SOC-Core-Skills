This repo contains a set of notes that covers Day 1-4 of John Strand's SOC Core Skills course, which focuses on fundamental skills necessary for security professionals. The course takes a practical approach by examining security concepts through the lens of incident response and compromise scenarios rather than dry technical explanations. John covers TCP/IP networking fundamentals, packet analysis with tcpdump and Wireshark, and emphasizes the importance of mastering core skills rather than relying solely on security tools. The course is designed to build a foundation for security analysis by teaching participants how to understand the underlying technologies they'll encounter in security roles.

## Key Takeaways

1. Core technical fundamentals (Windows, Linux, TCP/IP) are essential for security professionals, as all security tools ultimately rely on these foundations.
2. The TCP/IP model (Network Access, Internet, Transport, Application) is more practically useful than the OSI model for understanding how networks actually function.
3. Effective incident response requires building a toolkit of fundamental skills (like "Legos") that can be assembled to solve complex security problems.
4. Packet analysis tools like tcpdump and Wireshark are complementary - tcpdump excels at high-speed data capture, while Wireshark is superior for in-depth packet analysis and visualization.
